# The Chauhan's Hotel Website

## Project Overview
This project is a modern, responsive website for "The Chauhan's," a luxury hotel inspired by the grand palaces of Indian royal heritage. This website was developed as part of an internship to demonstrate skills in front-end web development.

The site is structured as a single-page application, providing a seamless browsing experience. It features dedicated sections for rooms, facilities, a booking form, and beautiful galleries showcasing the royal history and interiors of the mahals.

## Key Features
- **Responsive Design:** The website is fully optimized for a flawless viewing experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Single-Page Layout:** All major sections (`Home`, `Rooms`, `Facilities`, `Booking`, `Gallery`, `Contact`) are accessible from the main page via smooth-scrolling anchor links.
- **Detailed Pages:** Separate, dedicated pages provide in-depth information and photo galleries for individual rooms and mahals.
- **Backend Integration:** The booking and contact forms are fully functional, using Formspree to handle submissions without server-side code.
- **Elegant UI/UX:** The design incorporates a sophisticated color palette and typography that reflects the hotel's royal theme.
